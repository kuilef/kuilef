# Hi, I’m Ilya Kuznetsov

I build practical, product-focused software — from Android apps to Web3 tooling and small SaaS experiments.

## Projects

### Anotepad (Android, open source)
A lightweight note-taking app where each note is a plain text file. Designed to stay simple, fast, and portable, with optional Google Drive sync for those who want it.

### Fideseal (SaaS / Web3 timestamping)
A proof-of-existence / timestamping service: create verifiable timestamps for documents and text (e.g., Terms, policies, agreements, proofs) anchored on a blockchain for auditability.

### Blood Donation Map (Israel)
A web app that visualizes Magen David Adom (MDA) blood donation station locations across Israel on an interactive map, helping users find nearby stations and register for donation appointments.

### FeedCraft (Telegram bot)
A multi-purpose Telegram bot that aggregates news from Telegram channels, generates condensed AI-powered digests, and auto-publishes summaries to your channels.

### TrustTag (Chrome extension)
A Chrome extension that displays warning banners on websites with questionable content. It helps users identify potentially misleading or problematic pages with visible alerts and custom notes.

### Collectim / Shortie (video sharing + tracking)
A small service for sharing short videos with reliable previews and delivery. Focused on practical distribution (CDN-based) and lightweight tracking/analytics for engagement.

### CarLoanExit (consumer calculator)
A consumer-facing calculator to compare “what are my options” scenarios around car loan distress (e.g., sell vs surrender vs other paths). Built as a funnel-friendly tool with clear outputs.

## What I’m into
- Shipping small products end-to-end (frontend, backend, infra, analytics)
- DevOps and pragmatic deployment (Docker, reverse proxies, VPS)
- Web3 integrations when they add real value (not for its own sake)
